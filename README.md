# FAQ about eduScrum
### What is eduScrum and how does it differ from traditional education? 
eduScrum is a framework that adapts the principles of Scrum, a project management system used in software development, to the educational setting. Unlike traditional education where teachers dictate the learning process, eduScrum delegates the responsibility for learning to the students. It promotes self-organization within student teams, encourages them to take ownership of their learning, and provides them autonomy within set frameworks. This is in contrast to a more teacher-led, directive approach. The focus shifts to intrinsic motivation, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

### What are the core principles of eduScrum and how do they impact learning? 
eduScrum is built upon three pillars: Transparency, Review (Inspection), and Adaptation. Transparency ensures that all aspects of the learning process are visible and understandable to everyone involved. Review (Inspection) involves frequent checks of progress and outcomes to identify deviations from the plan. Adaptation emphasizes the need to adjust plans and processes swiftly if they are not working. These principles help students become more self-aware, collaborative, and adept at problem-solving, leading to more effective and efficient learning. It also allows for a continuous improvement cycle.

### What roles are involved in eduScrum and what are their responsibilities? 
The key roles in eduScrum are: the Teacher, who acts as both Product Owner and eduScrum Master (initially) defining the "what" and "why" of learning, setting Celebration Criteria, and facilitating the learning process, gradually passing more responsibility to the students; the Student Team, which is self-organizing and responsible for determining how they will achieve the learning objectives; and the Team Captain, who is a member of the team and takes on some of the responsibilities of an eduScrum Master within the team, ensuring the team is following the process, and helps the teacher by making progress transparent. Teams are multidisciplinary, with members possessing a variety of skills and areas for development.

### What are the key ceremonies (meetings) in eduScrum and what happens at each? 
eduScrum uses time-boxed ceremonies to create structure and predictability. These include: The Sprint Planning Meeting, which marks the beginning of a sprint and where teams form, learning objectives are set, and the team plans their work; the Stand-up Meeting, a brief daily meeting for the team to synchronize activities and plan for the next meeting by reviewing progress, and identifying obstacles; the Sprint Review, which is a series of meetings throughout the sprint to keep teams focused on the quality of work and provides opportunities to assess progress compared to learning objectives; and the Sprint Retrospective, a post-sprint meeting where the team reflects on its performance, identifies areas for improvement, and develops a plan to enhance collaboration and learning for the next sprint. In addition, Team Formation happens at the beginning of a sprint where the teacher or students choose team captains who then choose their teammates based on complimentary skills.

### What is the "Flap" in eduScrum and what purpose does it serve? 
The "Flap" is a physical, visual board (also called the eduScrum Board) that serves as a central tool for the team to track its work. It displays all the tasks required to achieve the learning objective for a sprint. Tasks are represented visually, moving from "To Do" to "Busy" to "Done," making the progress and status of the work highly transparent. The "Flap" also includes the Run Up Chart, and information about Celebration Criteria and work agreements. It is managed by the team captain and updated frequently.

### What are "Celebration Criteria" and why are they important in eduScrum?
Celebration Criteria are pre-determined requirements set by the teacher, like performance standards for tests, rubrics for presentation, project scopes, and deadlines. These criteria clarify what the team is expected to achieve to meet their learning objectives. Students use these criteria to self-manage their work, organize tasks, and ensure that their learning output meets the required standards, making clear, measurable goals for teams to meet.

### What is the difference between "Definition of Doing" and "Definition of Fun" in eduScrum?
"Definition of Doing" refers to the work agreements established by the student team. It specifies criteria the team establishes for what it means for work to be "done" (e.g. 'everyone understands the material', 'work is checked with all team members'). The "Definition of Fun" outlines the elements the team needs to have a pleasant, productive, and enjoyable working environment (e.g., 'laughing together', 'giving and receiving trust', 'listening to music'). These two definitions help to create a collaborative and enjoyable learning environment.

### How does eduScrum promote continuous improvement and personal development among students?
eduScrum emphasizes a process of continuous improvement through regular reviews and retrospectives. These ceremonies enable students to critically evaluate their progress, identify strengths and weaknesses, and adjust their approaches accordingly. Students also develop essential skills such as planning, self-organization, teamwork, and problem-solving, contributing to their personal growth. The reflection process also helps the student gain self-awareness of their contributions to the team. This cycle of inspection and adaptation promotes a continuous improvement in both academic and personal development.
